# Twooter

Twooter is a Web Application based on the concept of Twitter, but you can only make posts that are 10 characters in length. Built as a personal project, using the Django framework with Python, Django Channels, JavaScript and Ajax on the frontend, and an SQLite database. Deployed on Heroku with a Daphne web server and a Redis server for the channels and a PostgreSQL database, with media hosted on AWS S3.

You can't really download it locally because I have hidden a few different codes that are needed for it to run, but if you want to download it just contact me. 

## Disclaimer

Twitter is of course to blame for the original idea of Twitter and its themes. This is simply a reimagining of Twitter in some alternate universe.
